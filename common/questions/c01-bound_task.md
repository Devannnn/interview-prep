# What are CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks ?

The term X-bound designates a type of task which is limited by a specific ressource. It means this task is spending most of its time using that ressource and that its performance depends on the ressource’s access.

A CPU-bound task means that this task spends most of its time executing instructions on the CPU - for instance a program computing the decimals of pi. The CPU’s performance is the main bottleneck for this task. You improve the performance of a CPU-bound task by using multi-processing.

An I/O-bound task means that this task spends most its time waiting for external operations such as network, database or disk access. In that example, the disk’s performance is the main bottleneck for this task. You improve the performance of an I/O-bound task by using concurrency to keep executing operations during the waiting time.
